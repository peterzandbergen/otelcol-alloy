== Introduction



== Otel Collector

The OpenTelemetry collector is the preferred way to receive, process and export telemetry data. 
The https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/tree/main[opentelemetry-collector-releases] repository currently offers https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/tree/main/distributions[5 distributions].

The https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/tree/main/distributions/otelcol-contrib[otelcol-contrib] distribution contain a myriad of receivers, processors and exporters. 
This makes this distro suited for most use cases.

You configure the OtelCollector with one or more yaml files that specify the pipelines to ingest, process and send out the telemetry data.

Alloy is a Grafana product that performs the same task as the OpenTelemetry collector
